# Managing licenses

## Obtain a License

After purchasing the GraphDB AMI from the AWS Marketplace, the client will need to obtain a license to activate and use the software.
The license is provided by an Ontotext representative as part of the post-purchase process.

To obtain the license, the client should follow these steps:
1. **Contact Ontotext Representative:** Reach out to the designated Ontotext representative who will assist you with the license acquisition process.
   You can contact the representative through e-mail at salesteam@ontotext.com, or by using our [contact form](https://www.ontotext.com/contact/).
2. **Provide Purchase Information:** Provide the necessary information related to your GraphDB AMI purchase from the AWS Marketplace.
   This includes details such as the AWS account used for the purchase, the specific AMI identifier, and any relevant purchase order or transaction ID.
3. **License Verification:** The Ontotext representative will verify your purchase information and validate the eligibility for a license.
   They may require additional details or documentation for verification purposes.
4. **License Generation:** Once the purchase is verified, the Ontotext representative will generate a license for your GraphDB deployment.
   The license is specific to your AWS account and the purchased AMI.
5. **License Delivery:** The representative will provide you with the license file or license key needed to activate GraphDB.
   The delivery method can vary depending on the arrangement with the representative.
   It could be sent via email or shared through a secure file transfer method.


By following these steps and working closely with the Ontotext representative, you will be able to obtain and activate the necessary license for your GraphDB AMI purchased from the AWS Marketplace.
