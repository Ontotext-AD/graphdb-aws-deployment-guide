# Rotating Credentials

GraphDB supports several authentication methods:

* [Basic authentication](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.3/access-control.html#basic-authentication): 
  The username and password are sent in a header as plain text 
  (usually used when using the RDF4J client, or via Java when run with cURL). Enabled by default (can be optionally disabled).
* [GDB](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.3/access-control.html#gdb-authentication): 
  Token-based authentication used by the Workbench for username/password login.  
  This login method is also available through the REST API. Enabled by default (can be optionally disabled).
* [Kerberos](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.3/access-control.html#kerberos-authentication): 
  Highly secure single sign-on protocol that uses tickets for authentication. 
  Disabled by default (must be configured to be enabled).
* [X.509 certificate authentication](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.3/access-control.html#x-509-certificate-authentication): 
  When a certificate is signed by a trusted authority, or is otherwise validated, 
  the device holding the certificate can validate documents. Disabled by default (must be configured to be enabled).
* [OpenID](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.3/access-control.html#openid-authentication): 
  Single sign-on method that allows accessing GraphDB without the need for creating a new password.
  Its biggest advantage is the delegation of the security outside the database. Disabled by default (must be configured to be enabled).

User credentials rotation depends on the chosen authentication method and identity provider.
