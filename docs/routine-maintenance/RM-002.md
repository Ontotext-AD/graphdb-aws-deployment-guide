# Software patches and upgrades

Ontotext releases regular GraphDB patches that cover any security vulnerabilities discovered. 
Prior to release, we automatically test our packages with Trivy and other vulnerability scanners.

We commit to a high standard of security and, upon being notified of any vulnerabilities in our application 
we can release a hotfix as soon as possible.

Our team is always keeping track of up-to-date vulnerabilities.
