# (DAS-004 Testing and troubleshooting

**Testing GraphDB**

To ensure GraphDB is operating correctly when deployed in AWS, we recommend the following steps (sanity tests):

1. Import sample RDF datasets into GraphDB.
2. Execute a variety of SPARQL queries to validate data retrieval and manipulation.
3. Test GraphDB's support for different query types, including basic queries, filtering, aggregations, and joins.
4. Verify the accuracy and completeness of query results.
5. Test the consistency and integrity of data after updates, inserts, and deletions.

**Troubleshooting GraphDB**

If you encounter any difficulties while using GraphDB, start by checking the GraphDB log files

If the logs do not provide clear information about the issue, please refer to the "Support" section, specifically "(SUP-001) How to receive support," to request assistance from the appropriate channels.
