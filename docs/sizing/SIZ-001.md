# Sizing and required resources

The best approach for correctly sizing the hardware resources is to estimate the number of explicit statements. 

Statistically, an average dataset has 3:1 statements to unique RDF resources. 

The total number of statements determines the expected repository image size, 
and the number of unique resources affects the memory footprint required to initialize the repository.

Please refer to the [hardware sizing documentation](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.2/requirements.html#hardware-sizing)
