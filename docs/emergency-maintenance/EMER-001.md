# (EMER-001) Handling fault conditions

When deployed in a cluster GraphDB employs the RAFT consensus algorithm to effectively manage multiple GraphDB nodes and ensure data replication across all nodes. 

If a fault occurs in one of the nodes the rest will continue to function. 

If the failing node does not recover we recommend you to open a support case right away. For more information please refer to [(SUP-001) How to receive support](../support/SUP-001).
