# GraphDB Deployment Guide

## System Requirements

### Supported Platforms

GraphDB is supported on systems with x86_64 and ARM architectures on physical, virtual, or containerized platforms.

## Hardware Requirements
* **CPU**: Should be noted that the license limits the number of CPU cores (This affects inferencing and read requests).
* **Memory**: Please refer to the [hardware sizing documentation](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.3/requirements.html#hardware-sizing).
* **Storage**: A `gp3` or `io` type volume is recommended, NFS file systems are not recommended.

## Software Requirements
Java Development Kit 11-16

## Deploying on Amazon Web Services

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need access to an AWS account in which GraphDB will be deployed.
It is also recommended that you create an [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) 
for the deployment and not use the root user account.

You will also need to create a shell script, which will install and run GraphDB as a service. 
This script will be used to initialize the EC2 instances. See [Installing GraphDB on EC2](#installing-graphdb)

### Preparation of AWS Resources
1. **Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).**

You’ll need to create three private subnets and optionally three public subnets, if GraphDB will be accessible from the internet.

The subnets should be in three availability zones and if Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances require outbound traffic,

NAT gateways will be needed. For redundancy, you’ll need to create at least two NAT gateways.

Make sure, that you enable DNS hostnames and DNS resolutions on the VPC.

The easiest way to create all of the above is to use the “VPC and more” option when creating the VPC.

2. **Create a "Launch template".** 

The launch template is the blueprint of the EC2 instances.

We recommend the official `Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS 64-bit` Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and `r6i.xlarge` instance type.

This should be able to handle a repository of up to on billion statements.

Choose the default security group for the VPC. 
Security groups act as a firewall, and controls traffic to and from AWS resources. 
The default security group allows all inbound and outbound traffic and is good enough to start with, 
but you should consider creating custom security groups. 

Make sure, that the security group allows inbound and outbound traffic 
to ports `7200` (GraphDB HTTP API) and `7300` (GraphDB raft internal communication),
from the private subnets. Also, the load balancer should be able to forward to port 7200.

To be able to persist greater amounts of data, you’ll need to attach an additional Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volume.

Create a new EBS volume, size of 100Gi should be enough, but keep in mind that backups and replication snapshots
will require around double the used storage. 

For type choose `gp3` and depending on the usage patterns, you might need to increase the IOPS. 
For the device name choose `/dev/sdf`.

To complete the Launch template creation, upload or copy and paste the script
you've created as part of the prerequisites in the user data section.

3. **Create an Auto Scaling group, attach a target group and create a Network Load Balancer.**

When creating the Auto Scaling group, you’ll have the options to create the target group and the load balancer.

Start by creating an Auto Scaling group. 
Select the Launch template that you just created, your VPC and all three private subnets. 
Depending on the size of the cluster (number of nodes) set the Desired, Minimum and Maximum capacity, usually, this is three.

Next, choose “Attach to a new load balancer” and select a Network load balancer. 
Depending on your needs select the scheme of the load balancer to be either internal or internet-facing.
Change the listener port to `7200` and select create a target group.

After creating the Auto Scaling group, the creation of the EC2 instances should begin,
but there are some changes to the Target and Auto Scaling groups that need to be made:
* Go to the newly created target group
* Change the health check path to `/rest/cluster/node/status`
* Under advanced health check settings, select traffic port

For the Auto Scaling group, under Health checks, click edit and check Turn on Elastic Load Balancing health checks.


**Note:** Creating the required by GraphDB infrastructure in AWS will incur costs.
While some resources are eligible for the free tier, we advise you to use the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) 
to get an estimate of the total cost.

### Installing GraphDB
Before installing GraphDB, make sure the EC2 instance meets the System Requirements.

**Install GraphDB from the standalone distribution archive**

GraphDB requires a Java Development Kit (JDK) to be installed. The recommended version is 11, but anything prior to version 17 should work as well.

[Register](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/download/), download and unzip the GraphDB distribution in the EC2 instance.

_The examples are with GraphDB 10.3 but version might differ._

```shell
$ unzip graphdb-10.3.0-dist.zip
```

Move it to `/opt` and create a symlink to it:
```shell
$ mv graphdb-10.3.0 /opt/
$ ln -s /opt/graphdb-10.3.0 /opt/graphdb
```

Create a user and group for GraphDB and give it permissions on the installation directory:
```shell
$ groupadd graphdb
$ useradd -g graphdb graphdb -s /bin/bash
$ chown -R graphdb:graphdb /opt/graphdb-10.3.0
```

**Running as a console application:**
```shell
/opt/graphdb/bin/graphdb
```

Or to run it in the background, use:
```shell
/opt/graphdb/bin/graphdb -b
```

GraphDB should now be accessible on the public IP of the EC2 instance at port `7200`.
_(If you don't have a public IP, you can create a VPN connection)_

To stop GraphDB, press `CTRL + C`, if you have started it in the foreground, otherwise, you can execute the following command:
```shell
/opt/graphdb/bin/graphdb stop
```

**Running as systemd service**

GraphDB can be configured to be managed by systemd and also to start automatically when the system starts.

Create the file `/lib/systemd/system/graphdb.service`

```shell
[Unit]
Description="GraphDB Engine"
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s
User=graphdb
Group=graphdb
ExecStart="/opt/graphdb/bin/graphdb"
TimeoutSec=120
SuccessExitStatus=143

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reload systemd, to pick the GraphDB unit file:
```shell
$ systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable the service to run at system start up:
```shell
$ systemctl enable graphdb
```

Start the GraphDB service:
```shell
$ systemctl start graphdb
```

Check its status:
```shell
$ systemctl status graphdb
```

### Creating the Cluster

A cluster can be created interactively from the Workbench or programmatically via the REST API.

To create a cluster between three or more GraphDB nodes 
please refer to the [documentation](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.3/creating-a-cluster.html#create-cluster)
