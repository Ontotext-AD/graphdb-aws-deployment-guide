# GraphDB Deployment guide

## System Requirements

### Supported Platforms

GraphDB is supported on systems with x86_64 and ARM architectures on physical, virtual, or containerized platforms.

## Hardware Requirements
* **CPU**: Should be noted that the license limits the number of CPU cores (This affects inferencing and read requests)
* **Memory**: Please refer to the [hardware sizing documentation](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.2/requirements.html#hardware-sizing)
* **Storage**: A `gp3` or `io` volume is recommended, NFS file systems are not recommended.

## Software Requirements
Java Development Kit 11-16

## Amazon Web Services
### Account and Permissions
Before starting, you need access to an AWS account in which GraphDB will be deployed.
For security reasons, it is recommended that you create an [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) 
for the deployment and not use the root account.

### Required resources

You need to be able to create the following resources:

* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) _(an existing VPC can be used as well)_
* Private subnets
* Public subnets _(if GraphDB will be exposed to the public internet)_
* Auto-scaling groups
* Security groups
* Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instances
* Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes


### Steps 
1. **Create VPC**
* Enter name
* CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
* DNS hostnames and resolution should be enabled
2. **Create a private subnets**
[//]: # (* For single instance deployments - create one subnet: 10.0.0.0/19)
* For cluster deployments, you’ll need at least three subnets in different availability zones: 10.0.0.0/19, 10.0.32.0/19, 10.0.64.0/19
3. **Create public subnets** _(Optional - if GraphDB should be publicly accessible)_ 
* For cluster deployments, you’ll need at least three subnets in different availability zones: 10.0.128.0/20, 10.0.144.0/20, 10.0.160.0/20
4. **Create an Auto Scaling group**
* Set a name
* Click on Create a launch template
  * Set a Launch template name
  * Select Ubuntu as the AMI (TODO: we need to add our AMI when it’s available)
* For architecture select 64-bit (x86)
* Add a second EBS volume
  * Size: 100
  * Device name: /dev/sdf
  * Type: gp3
  * IOPS: 16000
* Select the newly create Launch Template and click next
* Select your VPC, and the availability zones of your subnets

**TODO** finish this



## Installing GraphDB on EC2 
Before installing GraphDB, make sure the EC2 instance meets the System Requirements.

**Install GraphDB from the standalone distribution archive**

GraphDB requires a Java Development Kit (JDK) to be installed. The recommended version is 11, but anything prior to version 17 should work as well.

[Register](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/download/), download and unzip the GraphDB distribution in the EC2 instance.

```shell
$ unzip graphdb-10.2.2-dist.zip
```

Move it to `/opt` and create a symlink to it:
```shell
$ mv graphdb-10.2.2 /opt/
$ ln -s /opt/graphdb-10.2.2 /opt/graphdb
```

Create a user and group for GraphDB and give it permissions on the installation directory:
```shell
$ groupadd graphdb
$ useradd -g graphdb graphdb -s /bin/bash
$ chown -R graphdb:graphdb /opt/graphdb-10.2.2
```

**Running as a console application:**
```shell
/opt/graphdb/bin/graphdb
```

Or to run it in the background, use:
```shell
/opt/graphdb/bin/graphdb -b
```

GraphDB should now be accessible on the public IP of the EC2 instance at port `7200`.
_(If you don't have a public IP, you can create a VPN connection)_

To stop GraphDB, press `CTRL + C`, if you have started it in the foreground, otherwise, you can execute the following command:
```shell
/opt/graphdb/bin/graphdb stop
```

**Running as systemd service**

GraphDB can be configured to be managed by systemd and also to start automatically when the system starts.

Create the file `/lib/systemd/system/graphdb.service`

```shell
[Unit]
Description="GraphDB Engine"
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s
User=graphdb
Group=graphdb
ExecStart="/opt/graphdb/bin/graphdb"
TimeoutSec=120
SuccessExitStatus=143

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reload systemd, to pick the GraphDB unit file:
```shell
$ systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable the service to run at system start up:
```shell
$ systemctl enable graphdb
```

Start the GraphDB service:
```shell
$ systemctl start graphdb
```

Check its status:
```shell
$ systemctl status graphdb
```
