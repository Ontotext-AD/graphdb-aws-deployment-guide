# Testing and Troubleshooting

**Testing GraphDB**

To ensure GraphDB is operating correctly when deployed in AWS, we recommend the following steps (sanity tests):

1. Import sample RDF datasets into GraphDB.
2. Execute a variety of SPARQL queries to validate data retrieval and manipulation.
3. Test GraphDB's support for different query types, including basic queries, filtering and aggregations.
4. Test the consistency and integrity of data after updates, inserts and deletions.

**Troubleshooting GraphDB**

If you encounter any difficulties while using GraphDB, start by checking the GraphDB log files.

If the logs do not provide clear information about the issue, please refer to [How to receive support](../support/SUP-001) 
to request assistance from the appropriate channels.

You can find more information on diagnosing errors [here](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.3/diagnosing-and-reporting-critical-errors.html).
