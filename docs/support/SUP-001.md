# How to Receive Support

The preferred method for receiving support is through support tickets. 
Ontotext utilizes Jira, the industry-standard issue tracking system developed by Atlassian, 
to manage and track support tickets. 
Ticket editing in Jira is also employed to ensure adherence to response and resolution times.

After purchasing a GraphDB license and optional product support SLA, clients will have access to a dedicated service desk.
This service desk serves as a central point of contact for clients to submit support tickets, receive assistance, 
and track the progress of their inquiries. 
It provides a streamlined and efficient process for addressing any technical issues or concerns that may arise 
during the usage of GraphDB.
