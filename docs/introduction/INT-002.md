# (INT-002) Overview of a typical customer deployment

__TODO__

GraphDB is deployed in a cluster on AWS where the leader and the different followers are created in multiple availability zones, which allow high availability and simple configuration. Depending on the package that was chosen a different number of cluster nodes are deployed. The smallest deployment contains 3 different GraphDB nodes. For more information about the GraphDB cluster, please refer to https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.2/cluster-basics.html.

GraphDB AWS Components - **ToDo** are the components fixed at this point or they can be changed later on?

| Resource              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GraphDB EC2           | EC2 instance in which a GraphDB leader or follower node is started. The number of EC2 instances that are deployed depends on the size of the cluster, i.e. a 3-node cluster would use 3 EC2 instances. |
| VPC Internet Gateway  | Used to enable connections to the GraphDB workbench from the Internet.                                                                                                                                 |
| EBS Volumes           | EBS volumes are used for data storage when operating the database                                                                                                                                      |
| Network Load Balancer | Distributes the load between all GraphDB nodes                                                                                                                                                         |
| S3                    | The S3 bucket is used to store the regular data backups that are made                                                                                                                                  |
| Elastic Block Store   | The GraphDB data is stored in an Elastic Block Store (EBS). So if a 3-node cluster is deployed 3 EBS volumes will be used.                                                                             |
| NAT Gateway           |                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
