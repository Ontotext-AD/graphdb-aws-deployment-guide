# Time for Deployment

The typical deployment time for GraphDB cluster on AWS can take up to two hours for an experienced party familiar with the process. 
To automate the deployment process of deploying the cluster and reduce the time, Terraform scripts are available. 

**TODO add links to Terraform scripts**.

For more information on how to manually deploy GraphDB on AWS see [Deployment guide](../deployment-assets/DAS-001)
