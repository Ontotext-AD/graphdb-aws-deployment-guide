## Main Applications

### Content Management
If you are a content-centric enterprise, knowledge graphs can help you better utilize and repackage your content. 
By enriching your content with additional metadata, you can make it easier to discover and explore, generate better
feeds, improve user engagement on your website, suggest better recommendations and more. 
Content enrichment can be automated by the use of text analysis.

### Knowledge Management
Having the right knowledge about your products, devices, technical documentation, skills and competencies, research 
teams performance, etc. is crucial for many processes within an organization. 
By developing domain-specific taxonomies and vocabularies to populate the semantic model of a knowledge graph, 
you can better classify your documents and thus improve your knowledge discovery and analytics.
